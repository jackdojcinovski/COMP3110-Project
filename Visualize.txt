3. How can you visualize file change information?

We have chosen 3 different ways to visualize file changes;

1. Git/GitHub-like Diff Viewer
In this view, the GUI displays the old file on the left and the new file on the right, side by side.

Green lines in the new file indicate that the line matches perfectly with the old file.

Yellow lines in the new file indicate that the line exists in the old file but at a different line number;
 the old line index is displayed next to it.

Red lines in the new file indicate that the line is newly added.

Blue highlights in the old file indicate that the line has been modified in the new file.

This visualization allows the user to quickly identify unchanged lines, moved lines, added lines, and modifications, similar to the diff views in GitHub or VS Code.


2. Mapping Viewer

In this view, the GUI displays the relationship between line numbers.
It displays which old lines maps to which new lines, based on the LCSMapper algorithm

An example mockup would be :
1-------->2
2-------->1
3-------->-1

Lefthand side is the old file, and the index to the right is which line in the new file it maps to.
If necessary, we would consider adding a "(modified)" to the right of a modified file from the old file to the new file.


3. Mapping Table
Similar to the Mapping Viewer, a simple tabular view listing each line, the corresponding new line, and what kind of change occured.

An example is as follows:

OLD | NEW | TYPE

1   | 1   | same
2   | 3   | moved
3   | 2   | moved
4   | -1  | deleted
-   | 5   | added


These are our 3 ways of implementing a GUI to visualize file changes. 
They are all effiecient at providing the necessary information needed to detetct file changes, from one file to another.
